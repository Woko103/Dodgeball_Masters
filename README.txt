Dodgeball Masters is a frenetic game where two teams will compete
until one stands above the other by process of elimination.

There are 8 different characters, where each one of them has its own strengths and weaknessess.
It's a 3v3 gameplay, where the process of elimination is the only way to achieve victory.

Happy gaming :)
